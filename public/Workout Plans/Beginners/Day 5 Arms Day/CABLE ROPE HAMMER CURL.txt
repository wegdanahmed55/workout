The first target of this exercise is brachialis and brachioradialis muscles. The cable rope aids in the upward movement, allowing you to squeeze up the biceps for a maximum contraction. The development of the brachioradialis muscle helps to strengthen your grip and can make your arm muscles appear stronger and more voluminous.
