Bent over dumbbell row is a functional exercise that works several muscle groups at the same time. This exercise, which is very popular in bodybuilding and power sports, is very effective for the development of improved muscle strength, endurance and overall body strength. It also activates the trapezius muscles, and may benefit discomfort caused by muscle weakness such as postural posture and shoulder blade protrusion by affecting the infraspinatus and subscapula muscles that cover the scapula.
You can add it to your training programs as part of muscle growth and upper body strength training.
