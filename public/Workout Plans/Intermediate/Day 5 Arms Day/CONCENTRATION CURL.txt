Concentration curls are a great arm movement to stimulate the muscle fibers at the top of the brachialis muscle and biceps. Additionally, you can use this movement to correct symmetry issues. (for example, if one bicep is bigger than another)
Because you turn your arm in toward your body when you do concentration curls, it helps to place more focus on the long head of the biceps, which makes up the mass of the biceps peak.
Concentration curl movement is the exercise that has the most impact on the biceps muscles in electromyography tests. If you want to increase your arm size, strength, and appearance, the dumbbell concentration curl is for you.
