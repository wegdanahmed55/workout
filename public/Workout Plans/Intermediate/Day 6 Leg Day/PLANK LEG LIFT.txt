As a multi-functional movement, the plank leg lift not only targets your abdominal muscles but also the spine and hip. Plank leg lift strengthens and tightens your entire body, improves your posture and balance, reduces body fat, and can help boost your metabolism.
Plank leg lift is an effective exercise that increases stability in the spine, core and hip areas by providing an isometric contraction. You can add it to your workouts to shape and strengthen your hip, core and leg muscles.
