This movement, which is performed on a machine with cables, is one of the chest movements that you can exercise your chest muscles from a to z in the most efficient way. You can target your lower, upper and middle chest muscles separately by changing the height of the cables on the station.

The higher the cables are the more you’ll emphasize your lower pecs. The lower the cables, and the more you’ll target the upper pecs. low cable crossover exercise is an excellent exercise to stretch your upper chest muscles, increase the range of motion and shred chest muscles
The tension in the cable provides a softer and more continuous resistance than free weights that can be affected by momentum. Thanks to constant resistance, it triggers the work of many small stabilizing muscles in your chest in addition to the pectoral muscles.
Thanks to free work, you do not experience muscle imbalance, your muscles develop equally and you feel that you are experiencing pump at the end of the exercise.
Low energy – High impact: The tension and resistance in this movement is evident throughout the range of motion of the entire exercise and is an optimal property that reduces wasted energy.
