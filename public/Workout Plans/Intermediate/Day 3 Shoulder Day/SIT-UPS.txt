Sit-ups exercise helps strengthen, tighten and shape core muscles. A strong core allows you to perform at higher levels during any sport or physical activity.
It helps strengthen the diaphragm: Sit-ups exercise causes abdominal tension that can have a positive effect on your diaphragm. A strong, healthy diaphragm can improve your breathing patterns and increase athletic endurance. One study examined the effects of various abdominal exercises in terms of diaphragm pressure and observed that sit-ups are beneficial in strengthening the diaphragm and improving respiratory function.
