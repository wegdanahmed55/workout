Ä°NCLINE BARBELL BENCH PRESS BENEFITS:

Incline barbell bench press is a compound upper chest exercise that contributes to the movement of multiple joints and muscles. As a variant of the flat bench press, it is considered one of the best exercises for building a stronger and larger upper body.
It targets your upper chest muscles due to the position of the movement. If you think your upper chest muscles are not developing, you can include the incline barbell bench press movement in your programs.

WHAT IS THE BEST ANGLE FOR THE UPPER CHEST?

It is certain that an angle of 30-45 degrees is required for the better development of the upper chest muscles, but there are still disputes between the two. Variability of the angle of inclination can make different muscles work Therefore, the correct sitting position is the most important element for the upper chest muscle to work.

One study concluded that the 30-degree angle was the best, while another research concluded that the best result was 45 degrees. Even though the studies cause confusion, the truth is that both results are effective.
