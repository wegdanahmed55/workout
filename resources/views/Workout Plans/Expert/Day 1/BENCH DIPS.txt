The triceps muscles are the three-part muscle structure that covers the back of the arm. The main purpose in back arm muscle movements is to focus on the triceps muscles. As most movements work all of the triceps muscles, there are muscle groups in which they are the main area of influence.
There are many exercises to build the triceps muscles, but instead of doing all these movements in the same workout, focus on choosing exercises that emphasize all different parts of the triceps.
