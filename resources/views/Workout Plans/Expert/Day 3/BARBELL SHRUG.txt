The focus of the barbell shrug exercise is the trapezius muscles. Barbell shrug is the most important exercise for developing strength in the trapezius muscles as it fully activates the muscle fibers in the upper back.
A strong and tight trapezius muscle supports your neck by preventing your head from falling forward and allows you to stand upright.
