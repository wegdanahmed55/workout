Face pull is a tremendous exercise that effectively works many muscles, including the shoulder, back, wing and trapezius muscles. It also activates the trapezius muscles, and may benefit discomfort caused by muscle weakness such as postural posture and shoulder blade protrusion by affecting the infraspinatus and subscapula muscles that cover the scapula. In addition, face pull is one of the most effective corrective exercises that help compensate for poor posture and shoulder dysfunction.
