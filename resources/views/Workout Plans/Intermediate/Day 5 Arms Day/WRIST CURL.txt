WRIST CURL BENEFITS:

You can do this movement using a barbell or dumbbell.
It is a very effective exercise to improve the forearm and wrist muscles. If you build up your wrists and forearms you will be able to lift more weight while performing other exercises.
The reason you cannot lift your body weight may be due to weak wrists and arms. Adding wrist and forearm exercise to your workout program will create strong wrist flexors.
