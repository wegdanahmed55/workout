The first target of this exercise is the brachioradialis muscle. The brachioradialis is a superficial forearm muscle located in the lateral forearm.
The development of the brachioradialis muscle helps to strengthen your grip and can make your arm muscles appear stronger and more voluminous.
It is recommended to combine various exercises such as hammer curl in order to develop the entire arm muscles.
