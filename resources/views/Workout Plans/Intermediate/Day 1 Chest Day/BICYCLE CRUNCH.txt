BICYCLE CRUNCH BENEFITS:

-In a study conducted by the American Council of Exercise, the Bicycle crunch exercise is described as one of the most effective exercises that best work the rectus abdominus, strengthen the abdominal muscles and support six-pack formation.
-Bicycle Crunch also targets your hip flexors. While your rectus abdominus muscle stabilizes your core during exercise, your hip flexors take on the task of raising your knees. By combining upper and lower body at the same time, the muscles work in harmony. This situation is very beneficial in terms of your mobility and flexibility.
-It works the muscles from every angle: The bicycle crunch exercise allows you to exercise your core muscles from every angle with the rotation curl you do. When even the tiniest muscle fibers work from different angles, they interact to tighten, develop and strengthen your core muscles.
-Improves coordination: When you pedal like cycling, movements that force you to use opposite working arms and legs at the same time can help improve your coordination. As your coordination gain increases, your ability to practice movement skills begins to increase.
-Provides calorie burning: The bicycle crunch exercise is a more intense movement compared to other sit-ups. Compound exercises are exercises that work the muscles of two or more joints in your body. Basically, multiple muscles work together to perform a movement. This approach is effective because you can train more than one muscle at the same time. Doing compound exercises is more beneficial than isolation exercises. With compound movements, more muscle is used, which means more energy is spent and ultimately more fat is burned.
