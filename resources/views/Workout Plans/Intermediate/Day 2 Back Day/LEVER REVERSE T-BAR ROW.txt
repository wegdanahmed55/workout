T-bar row are a strength training exercise that mimics the movement of rowing a boat. The goal is to strengthen the muscles that bring the arms toward the body, as well as those that move the shoulder blades toward the spine. The t-bar row can allow you to lift more weight. Due to the nature of this movement, you are able to leverage more weight.
The T bar, which targets the entire back chain, targets the latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus, trapezius, posterior deltoids and rhomboids, so adding exercises such as barbell rows and t-bar rows to your training programs will be beneficial for the development of back muscles.
